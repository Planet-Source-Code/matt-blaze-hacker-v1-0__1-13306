<Mission Briefing>

Three bombs have been planted inside 
the MI6 Headquaters.  

They are directly linked to a computer  terminal 
1500 feet away from the building.

The only way to disarm the bombs is by
hacking your way into this computer 
terminal.

There is a tamper-proof device on the terminal 
which cannot be avoided.

Once you start disarming a countdown 
will begin.

If you fail to reset all 50 switches
 the bomb will detonate.

If the timers reach zero the bomb will detonate.

Good Luck...<END>
