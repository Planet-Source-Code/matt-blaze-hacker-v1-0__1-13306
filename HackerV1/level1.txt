<Mission Orders>

The only way to disarm all three
bombs at once is to reset 50
switches on the computer console.

A switch turns green once neutralised.

To reset switches you must type in 
the number displayed in two boxes as it 
shows up.

Reset all 50 switches and the bombs
are disarmed.

Note: Pressing 'enter' will blank the 
the box where you type.
